# Mandelbrot Set Visualization

This Python script generates and visualizes the Mandelbrot set, a famous fractal pattern known for its intricate and infinite detail. The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers that do not diverge when iterated through a simple mathematical formula. This visualization helps to showcase the beauty and complexity of fractal geometry.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`: For numerical operations and creating arrays.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting and visualizing the Mandelbrot set.

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
